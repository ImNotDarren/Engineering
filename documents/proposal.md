# Project Proposal
## Question/Need

Many people are suffering atrial fibrillation, which is the most frequent arrhythmia. Usually
people need to go to hospitals to be diagnosed which would take time and money. Now we're providing
a model that can detect AF based on information that you can obtain from your wearable devices.
Users simply need to upload the data to our website, and they can get the result.

## Data discription

The data is sourced from many lead Holter and wearable ECG monitoring devices. It provides ECG records
extracted from long-term dynamic ECGs and diagnosis which can help train the model.

## Tools

* **Waveform-database package** for loading data
* **Biosppy** for ecg processing
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plotting
* **PyTorch** for building neural network
* **Node.JS** for React front-end
* **Spring Boot** for back-end
* **AWS** for deployment
* **Pickle** for saving regression models in a pickle file

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be finishing building a rough model.
